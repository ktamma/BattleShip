<p>Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's warships and sink them. A paper and pencil version of the game dates back to World War I, but most people are familiar with the game through the plastic board game that was first marketed by the Milton Bradley Company in 1967. Since then, the game has spawned various video games and smartphone app variations. Today, the board game version is produced by Hasbro, the company that acquired Milton Bradley in 1984. 
   
    The gameplay is straightforward. Each player hides ships on a plastic grid containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship. 
   
    The game board each player gets has two grids: an upper and lower grid. The lower grid is used by the player to "hide" the location of his own ships, while the upper grid is used to record the shots fired toward the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits or misses.</p>
    
    
<h1>Game rules</h1>

Game Play: The basic Battleship rules and instructions for playing the game are each player calls out one shot (or coordinate) each turn in attempt to hit one of their opponent's ships. To hit one of your opponent's ships, you must call out a letter and a number of where you think one of their ships is located. The instructions state that once a shot is called, the opponent must immediately call out hit or miss. If one of your ships gets hit, place a red peg over the hole location on your ships that was called out. If calling a shot (or trying to hit your opponent's ships), mark a red peg (if a hit was made) or a white peg (a miss) on your target grid located on the lid or the vertical divider between you and your opponent. This will help you keep track of your hits and misses in your hunt to find their ships.

Once all holes on a ship have been filled with red pegs, your ship has sunk and must be removed from the ocean. You then announce which ship has sunk. The Battleship rules on successfully sinking a ship are as follows: Carrier - 5 hits, Battleship - 4 hits, Cruiser - 3 hits, Submarine - 3 hits, Destroyer - 2 hits. It is considered cheating and against the Battleship rules to be dishonest on the location of your ships.
